    The Cable News Network (CNN) is a multinational news channel and website headquartered in Atlanta, Georgia, U.S.[2][3][4] Founded in 1980 by American media proprietor Ted Turner and Reese Schonfeld as a 24-hour cable news channel, and presently owned by the Manhattan-based media conglomerate Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD),[5] CNN was the first television channel to provide 24-hour news coverage and the first all-news television channel in the United States.[6][7][8][9][10]

As of February 2023, CNN had 80 million television households as subscribers in the US.[11] According to Nielsen, in June 2021 CNN ranked third in viewership among cable news networks, behind Fox News and MSNBC, averaging 580,000 viewers throughout the day, down 49% from a year earlier, amid sharp declines in viewers across all cable news networks.[12] While CNN ranked 14th among all basic cable networks in 2019,[13][14] then jumped to 7th during a major surge for the three largest cable news networks (completing a rankings streak of Fox News at number 5 and MSNBC at number 6 for that year),[15] it settled back to number 11 in 2021[16] and had further declined to number 21 in 2022.[17]

Globally, CNN programming has aired through CNN International, seen by viewers in over 212 countries and territories;[18] since May 2019, however, the US domestic version has absorbed international news coverage in order to reduce programming costs. The American version, sometimes referred to as CNN (US), is also available in Canada, and some islands in the Caribbean. CNN also broadcasts in India where it is called CNN-News18, and in Japan, where it was first broadcast on CNNj in 2003, with simultaneous translation in Japanese.[19]
