Lady Gaga's debut album, 2008's The Fame, reached No. 2 on the Billboard 200. The album featured a pair of No. 1 singles: "Just Dance" and "Poker Face."
Gaga won her first two GRAMMYs at the 52nd GRAMMY Awards for Best Dance Recording ("Poker Face") and Best Dance/Electronic Album (The Fame). She also made her first performance appearance on the GRAMMY stage that same year, singing a medley that included "Poker Face" and "Speechless" and "Your Song" in a duet with Elton John.
