Not only does this make many of the movie's stunts and his physical performance all that more special, but comparing it to the original movie makes it truly shocking.
    Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One is another showcase for Tom Cruise's incredible action movie star qualities, but the movie also acts as a shocking reminder of the franchise's longevity thanks to his age. The seventh entry in the Mission: Impossible franchise arrived 27 years after the original movie that rebooted the TV series as an action/thriller movie series. Audiences have spent nearly three decades watching Tom Cruise becoming increasingly more daring with his stunts in an effort to bring more people to theaters and treat them to something they've never seen. It's only become more impressive as he gets older too.

	SUMMARY
 Tom Cruise's age in the Mission: Impossible franchise serves as a shocking reminder of the franchise's longevity, as he continues to perform daring stunts at 59 and 60 years old.
 Comparing Tom Cruise's age in Mission: Impossible 7 to Jon Voight's age in the original movie highlights Cruise's commitment and the franchise's success.
 Despite being in his 60s, Tom Cruise shows no signs of slowing down as Ethan Hunt, and he plans to continue playing the character until he is in his 80s, making Mission: Impossible movies even more exciting.

 Boston Celtics rookie Jordan Walsh is already working toward earning the trust of his teammates weeks ahead of the 2023-24 season.

When Walsh was selected 38th overall in this summer’s NBA draft, the Celtics envisioned Walsh’s greatest asset translating from Arkansas to Boston: Defense, something the C’s desperately need.

Since the Celtics have a questionable reserve unit tasked with supporting a star-studded core, Walsh has the perfect opportunity to grow as a household name in Boston, and so far, so good for the 19-year-old.
