    Tom Brady Tom Brady on coming out of retirement again: 'I wouldn't be around by tonight'. Brady joked that he isn't going to unretire for a second time.
    Tom Ince is ready to shut out the background noise and make a big impression at Watford after enduring one of the toughest seasons of his career.
    Tom Hanks, After graduating high school in Oakland, Hanks attended junior college before transferring into the theater program at California State University. He spent his summers acting and working at the Great Lakes Shakespeare Festival in Ohio until 1980 when he dropped out of college and moved to New York City. That same year, Hanks was cast as Kip Wilson on the sitcom Bosom Buddies, one of two advertising executives who dress in drag in order to rent an apartment in an all-female building. The exposure led to guest roles on Happy Days, Taxi, The Love Boat, and Family Ties.
    Tom Cruise, Despite appearing in a whole range of movies from romance to dramas, there's one genre that Tom Cruise dominates in - action films.
Whether it's playing Ethan Hunt, an agent of the Impossible Missions Force or US navy pilot LT Pete 'Maverick' Mitchell in Top Gun, the actor can usually found in the midst of a high octaine situation or fight scene.

However, Cruise has an unexpected clause in his movie contracts that most people don't know about. 

    Hanna (she/her) has been working professionally in the film industry for over 20 years. She won the Young Actors Award for her performance in Forrest Gump.
    Chaotic cat-and-mouse duo Tom and Jerry are up to their old tricks — setting traps and causing trouble — in this reboot of the classic franchise.
    The series features comic fights between an iconic set of adversaries, a house cat (Tom) and a mouse (Jerry). The plots of each short usually center on Tom's numerous attempts to capture Jerry and the mayhem and destruction that follows. Tom rarely succeeds in catching Jerry, mainly because of Jerry's cleverness, cunning abilities, and luck. However, on several occasions, they have displayed genuine friendship and concern for each other's well-being. At other times, the pair set aside their rivalry in order to pursue a common goal, such as when a baby escapes the watch of a negligent babysitter, causing Tom and Jerry to pursue the baby and keep it away from danger, in the shorts Busy Buddies and Tot Watchers respectively. Despite their endless attacks on one another, they have saved each other's lives every time they were truly in danger, except in The Two Mouseketeers, which features an uncharacteristically morbid ending, and Blue Cat Blues, where both sit on a railroad track at the end after being jilted by girlfriends. The cartoon irises out with the whistle of an oncoming steam train.

The cartoons are known for some of the most violent cartoon gags ever devised in theatrical animation: Tom may use axes, hammers, firearms, firecrackers, explosives, traps and poison to kill Jerry. On the other hand, Jerry's methods of retaliation are far more violent, with frequent success, including slicing Tom in half, decapitating him, shutting his head or fingers in a window or a door, stuffing Tom's tail in a waffle iron or a mangle, kicking him into a refrigerator, getting him electrocuted, pounding him with a mace, club or mallet, letting a tree or electric pole drive him into the ground, sticking matches into his feet and lighting them, tying him to a firework and setting it off, and so on.[2] While Tom and Jerry has often been criticized as excessively violent, there is no blood or gore in any scene.[3]: 42 [4]: 134 

Music plays a very important part in the shorts, emphasizing the action, filling in for traditional sound effects, and lending emotion to the scenes. Musical director Scott Bradley created complex scores that combined elements of jazz, classical, and pop music; Bradley also often used contemporary pop songs and songs from other films, including MGM films like The Wizard of Oz and Meet Me in St. Louis, which both starred Judy Garland in a leading role.

Generally, there is little dialogue as Tom and Jerry almost never speak; however, minor characters are not similarly limited, and the two lead characters do speak English on rare occasions. For example, the character Mammy Two Shoes has lines in nearly every cartoon in which she appears. Most of the vocal effects used for Tom and Jerry are their high-pitched laughs and gasping screams.
