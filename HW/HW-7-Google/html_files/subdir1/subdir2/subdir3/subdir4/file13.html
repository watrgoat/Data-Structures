Upon accepting the Statue from France, the U.S. committed to paying for the pedestal’s construction. The project’s organizers anticipated support from New York’s many titans of industry or the U.S. government. However, neither heeded the call. In 1885, as the Statue sailed to America, the pedestal was incomplete.

Hungarian immigrant and newspaper publisher Joseph Pulitzer saw this as an opportunity. “[It would be} an irrevocable disgrace to New York City and the American Republic to have France send us this splendid gift without our having provided even so much as a landing place for it,” he proclaimed.

Pulitzer inspired small donations from millions of Americans, printing in his newspaper, The World, the names of every contributor. His plan was a huge success, raising the remaining funds in a matter of weeks.

Since 1982, The Statue of Liberty-Ellis Island Foundation has partnered with the 
National Park Service to care for one of the world’s most beloved symbols-Liberty Enlightening the World.

Some exciting activities were initiated in conjunction with her 135th birthday (October 28):

The Foundation was invited to participate in “Honor Your Hometown,” an initiative by documentary producer Ken Burns featuring short videos from an extraordinary group of entertainers; representatives of the nation’s most iconic historic sites and museums; noted civic leaders; and many more.

In 1982, The Statue of Liberty-Ellis Island Foundation was established to raise funds for and oversee the Statue’s historic centennial restoration.  Once again, Americans rose to the occasion.

With individual contributions, purchases of Liberty commemoratives, and corporate donations, the Foundation raised the needed funds, completing the restoration without any government funding.

The nation celebrated together over Liberty Weekend in July 1986. Ships of all sizes gathered in New York Harbor, concerts marked the milestone, and unprecedented fireworks lit the sky in honor of our cherished statue.

With ongoing support from our generous donors, the Foundation has continued pursuing its mission of preserving this beacon of hope. Contributions have supported hundreds of projects large and small, implemented in collaboration with our National Park Service partner.

Our latest major initiative is the Statue of Liberty Museum, which opened in May 2019. Millions of dollars in donations, commemorated with a series of collectible medallions, made this award-winning museum a reality.

Harkening back to Pulitzer’s campaign, the Foundation conducted its first crowdfunding campaign and added the name of every donor giving at $18.86 to the museum’s “Founders Registry.”

In 1865, Édouard de Laboulaye, a French political intellectual and activist, proposed gifting the United States with a statue honoring the centennial of America’s independence, the abolition of slavery, and the long-standing friendship between the two nations.

French sculptor Auguste Bartholdi supported Laboulaye’s idea, and in 1870 began designing the globally recognized statue, “Liberty Enlightening the World.”
