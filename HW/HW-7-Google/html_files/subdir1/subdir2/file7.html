    Thomas Jeffrey Hanks was born in Concord, California, to Janet Marylyn (Frager), a hospital worker, and Amos Mefford Hanks, an itinerant cook.
    (Actor, director, producer, writer, born July 9, 1956 in Concord, California).

When Reader's Digest did a poll in 2013 to find out who are the 100 Most Trusted People in America, Tom Hanks came out as No. 1. It's no surprise that the much-beloved star of such hits as Big, Forrest Gump, Castaway, and Toy Story is one of the most powerful and well-respected actors in Hollywood. His accessibility and charisma have earned him comparisons with such screen legends as Jimmy Stewart, Cary Grant and Gary Cooper. Tom Hanks is the "everyman" whose portrayals make us reconsider our own moral choices. Watching him on screen, we think about what we would do--and have done. "And that's why we all love you so much," said Oprah in a 2001 interview with Hanks. "We recognize ourselves in your characters."
