    New England Patriots fans appear fed up with Bill Belichick. Frankly, it's surprising. For the better part of the past 20 years, legions of Patriots fans lived by the mantra "In Bill We Trust." With Belichick given carte blanche to run basically everything on the football side of the business, the team enjoyed an unprecedented run of success that included six Super Bowl wins.
    The New York Jets did not make a call to Tom Brady after Aaron Rodgers was lost for the season to a torn Achilles, sources say, and the all-time great has made it very clear that he's retired for real this time.

However, the door will officially remain open for Brady to play for any team -- at least until October and quite possibly longer.

Brady's purchase of a minority stake in the Raiders has not been finalized, sources say. A vote could come as soon as next month's Fall League Meeting, sources say, but there is still plenty to sort out with financing and plenty of information regarding a potential purchase still to be shared.

There's no guarantee the process is done by October, which means the Winter League Meeting in December could be the time for Brady to finally and firmly close the door on playing in the NFL.
