Class Name: Matrix

Description:
  A class for handling two-dimensional matrices.

Constructors and Destructor:
  - Default constructor: Creates an empty matrix.
  - Constructor with dimensions and fill value: Creates a matrix with specified dimensions and fills it with a given value.
  - Copy constructor: Creates a new matrix as a copy of an existing one.
  - Destructor: Deallocates memory and cleans up the matrix.

Assignment and Swapping:
  - Assignment operator: Copies the contents of another matrix.
  - Friend function 'swap': Swaps the contents of two matrices.

Getters:
  - 'get': Retrieve a value from the matrix at a specified position and store it in a referenced double.
  - 'num_rows': Get the number of rows in the matrix.
  - 'num_cols': Get the number of columns in the matrix.

Setters:
  - 'set': Set a value in the matrix at a specified position.

Utility Functions:
  - 'clear': Reset the matrix to an empty state and deallocate memory.
  - 'operator==': Check if two matrices are equal.
  - 'operator!=': Check if two matrices are not equal.

Matrix Arithmetic:
  - 'operator+': Add two matrices of equal size.
  - 'add': Add another matrix to the current one both equal size.
  - 'operator-': Subtract two matrices of equal size.
  - 'subtract': Subtract another matrix from the current one both equal size.

Scalar Operations:
  - 'multiply_by_coefficient': Multiply all elements by a specified coefficient.

Row and Column Operations:
  - 'swap_row': Swap two rows within the matrix if both are in bounds.
  - 'transpose': Transpose the matrix.

Matrix Slicing:
  - 'get_row': Get a pointer to a double array representing a specified row.
  - 'get_col': Get a pointer to a double array representing a specified column.
  - 'quarter': Return pointers to four different matrices (Upper Left, Upper Right, Lower Left, Lower Right).

Stream Output:
  - Overloaded stream operator '<<': Display the matrix in a readable format.
