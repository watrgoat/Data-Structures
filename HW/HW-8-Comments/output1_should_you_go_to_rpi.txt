HEY GUYS! I am glad this video has already helped a few people out :) I got one more anonymous response to my survey after I had filmed this video, and I wanted to add it here in case it helped anyone out:\nMAJOR: Mechanical Engineering\nUndergrad experience overall: Lonely and isolating. I did not enjoy college and felt guilty for not appreciating the opportunity to have higher education the way I should. I felt trapped in my decisions financially and in terms of future outlook. \nAcademic experience: A professor /= a teacher. Some professors are better than others. I did not find the courses difficult, but that the burden of learning is more on the student than previously. For many classes the learning of material occurs outside of class on your own, not in class.\nExtracurricular experience: I did not participate in any extracurricular activities. Entirely my fault not RPI's. I wanted to join clubs but had a hard time doing so.\nCollege living experience: I had wonderful roommates throughout my college experience. Dining halls were okay, dorms were okay, nothing especially good or bad.\nCosts of attendance: I think I could acquire the same level of knowledge from a much less expensive school. The true determination of worth for me at this point is whether the RPI name can help in getting a job. Thus far I do not believe the cost of RPI is worth it.\nAdministration: I am not the most knowledgeable about issues the student body and administration have. I did not participate in Greek life or any clubs or sports and I was a class before the Arch became required so I have not been directly impacted by the decisions of the administration. That doesn't mean that students aren't being impacted by the administration or that the administration is doing a good job. I am just ignorant regarding the situation and thus I don't think I have a meaningful opinion to provide on the topic.\nPandemic response: I think it was a difficult situation to handle. I was lucky to have off-campus housing and was not quite as impacted as some by RPI's response. I think RPI did a good job at deciding to shut down campus quickly. I think RPI could have handled choosing to move out and executing student moveout better. In terms of financials I do not yet have a full understanding of RPI's plan. For classes I would say that the transition has not been the smoothest but everyone is doing their best and I do not fault RPI for how online classes are being executed.\nTroy, NY: I think that there are nice things about Troy and surrounding areas as well as not so nice things, just as every area has.\nOther: My views of RPI and my college experience are most probably influenced by my mental health issues, bipolar and social anxiety, so anything I say is not necessarily representative of RPI, but just my individual experiences. Though I suppose this is true whether or not there are mental health issues. Anyway just know to take what I say with a grain of salt.

    Alpha Phi Omega - community service fraternity at RPI used to be located upstairs  in the Student Union - an option worth exploring if one is not drawn toward conventional Greek fraternity culture.

Yes, you should, but don't take the data structure course, the instructors are horrible.
