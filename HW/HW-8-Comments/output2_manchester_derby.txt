I am a Man City fan, but I have to ask the Man United players, how could they leave Haaland so wide open on the second goal.

    Because they don’t know what they’re doing out there. It’s so sad to see.

    The goalkeeper seems to have no anticipation of how the attack will unfold. Naturally,he should be prepared for crosses, but he ‘s just standing on the right side, leaving the net completely empty. Such scenes were frequently observed, indicating a lack of soccer IQ.

     @chadp6297  are you serious or are you one of those who’s willing to blame someone whether they’re good or bad? Where were the defenders to mark halland? He had a free header. Or you want the keeper to guard where the ball is and guard the other end all at once. I’m sure you’re one of those who haven’t gotten over De Gea

    Agreed! That header to goal by Haaland was so free

    Their defending and marking was questionable all game. Haaland had already gotten open for a header before that but he headed it right at Onana

     @evilwoodenboy7387  very correct. He had the same opportunity just before halftime and Onana pulled a miraculous save I’m sure they expected him to perform the same miracle twice 😂🤦🏾‍♂️

    Good question - at 4:30, McTominay didn't catch Silva until was already at the touchline, Lindelof left Haaland to cover Foden, Eriksen left Rodri to close the gap on Silva.  Maguire covered the near post. Evans chose to cover Rodri instead of Haaland.  If Evans covered Haaland, then Silva would have probably passed to Rodri - Onana would have had a better chance to cover, but still a tough choice to make.

    Rodri’s run took Haaland’s mark with him. Which left him completely free. But still he shouldn’t have been that open. Defensive Breakdown.

    First off, Maguire leaves Haaland because he sees Erkison and he tells him to cover Haaland while Maguire covers front post. Haaland starts cutting inside and Erikson follows Rodri instead. You can see how Lindelöf followed Foden thinking that Evans had Haaland covered. Evans followed Rodri because Erikson stopped following because the last Erikson saw, Lindelöf was still covering the back posted. So Lindelöf rushed Foden and Evans rushed Rodri while Haaland managed to make it all the way to the back post unmarked.
