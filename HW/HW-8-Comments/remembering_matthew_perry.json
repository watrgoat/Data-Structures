These words are true and worthy, he who has ears to hear let him hear, blessed is he who understands.)\r\n\r\n‚ÄúAnd as he sat upon the mount of Olives, the disciples came unto him privately, saying, Tell us, when shall these things be? and what shall be the sign of thy coming, and of the end of the world?‚Äù\r\nGospel of Matthew, chapter 24, verse 3.\r\n\r\n‚ÄúAnd he said, Take heed that ye be not deceived: for many shall come in my name, saying, I am Christ; and the time draweth near: go ye not therefore after them. But when ye shall hear of wars and commotions, be not terrified: for these things must first come to pass; but the end is not by and by. Then said he unto them, Nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom: and great earthquakes shall be in divers places, and famines, and pestilences; and fearful sights and great signs shall there be from heaven.‚Äù\r\nGospel of Luke, chapter 21, verse 8 to 11.\r\n\r\n‚ÄúAll these are the beginning of sorrows. Then shall they deliver you up to be afflicted, and shall kill you: and ye shall be hated of all nations for my name's sake. And then shall many be offended, and shall betray one another, and shall hate one another.‚Äù\r\nGospel of Matthew, chapter 24, verse 8 to 10.\r\n\r\n‚ÄúAnd there shall be signs in the sun, and in the moon, and in the stars; and upon the earth distress of nations, with perplexity; the sea and the waves roaring; men's hearts failing them for fear, and for looking after those things which are coming on the earth: for the powers of heaven shall be shaken. And then shall they see the Son of man coming in a cloud with power and great glory. And when these things begin to come to pass, then look up, and lift up your heads; for your redemption draweth nigh.‚Äù\r\nGospel of Luke, chapter 21, verse 25 to 28.\r\n\r\n‚ÄúFor God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life. For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved. He that believeth on him is not condemned: but he that believeth not is condemned already, because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God.‚Äù\r\nGospel of John, chapter 3, verse 16 to 18.\r\n\r\n‚ÄúFor I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures; And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures: And that he was seen of Cephas, then of the twelve: After that, he was seen of above five hundred brethren at once; of whom the greater part remain unto this present, but some are fallen asleep.‚Äù\r\nFirst Corinthians, chapter 15, verse 3 to 6.\r\n\r\n‚ÄúRepent therefore of this thy wickedness, and pray God, if perhaps the thought of thine heart may be forgiven thee.‚Äù\r\nActs, chapter 8, verse 22.\r\n\r\n‚ÄúJesus answered and said unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God.‚Äù\r\nGospel of John, chapter 3, verse 3.\r\n\r\n‚ÄúFrom that time Jesus began to preach, and to say, Repent: for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.‚Äù\r\nGospel of Matthew, chapter 4, verse 17.\r\n\r\n‚ÄúAfter two days will he revive us: in the third day he will raise us up, and we shall live in his sight.‚Äù\r\nHosea, chapter 6, verse 2.\r\n\r\n‚ÄúBut, beloved, be not ignorant of this one thing, that one day is with the Lord as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day.‚Äù\r\nSecond Peter, chapter 3, verse 8.\r\n\r\n‚Äúknowing this first, that there shall come in the last days scoffers, walking after their own lusts, and saying, Where is the promise of his coming? for since the fathers fell asleep, all things continue as they were from the beginning of the creation.‚Äù\r\nSecond Peter, chapter 3, verse 3 to 4.\r\n\r\n‚ÄúFor when they shall say, Peace and safety; then sudden destruction cometh upon them, as travail upon a woman with child; and they shall not escape.‚Äù\r\nFirst Thessalonians chapter 5, verse 3.\r\n\r\n‚ÄúFor the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God: and the dead in Christ shall rise first: then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air: and so shall we ever be with the Lord.‚Äù\r\nFirst Thessalonians, chapter 4, verse 16 to 17.\r\n\r\n‚Äúin a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed.‚Äù\r\nFirst Corinthians, chapter 15, verse 52.\r\n\r\n‚ÄúI tell you, in that night there shall be two men in one bed; the one shall be taken, and the other shall be left. Two women shall be grinding together; the one shall be taken, and the other left. Two men shall be in the field; the one shall be taken, and the other left.‚Äù\r\nGospel of Luke, chapter 17, verse 34 to 36.\r\n..............................................................."}
